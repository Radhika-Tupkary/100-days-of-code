# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started coding challenges on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Initial exercises on freeCodeCamp were really easy, but those helped me refresh my HTML, CSS.

### Day 2: January 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Installed Vue cli, read vue docs, played with sample programs of vue.js in jsfiddle. 

**Thoughts:** Although I had worked on Vue.js few months ago in my previous job, revising it today and playing with examples of vue.js cleared up many things. Feeling good (happy :)). 

### Day 3: February 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Read vue docs, played with Nuxt.js, started my first vue project.  

**Thoughts:** Man, it was so difficult to find that one hr after a tough day at office..
